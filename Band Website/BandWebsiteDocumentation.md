##Band Website Documentation

- We first discussed how we wanted the website to look and what our band's name/genre would be.

- Althea and Arnie did the coding, Pepe decided the band's genres and theme, and I picked fonts.

- We all wrote our bios and sent images to Althea for use on the website.

- Troubleshooting was required when we encountered a 404 error online. We sought help from ChatGPT, but its suggestions were not relevant to the actual problem.

- The website name did not match Althea's GitHub username, and when that was corrected, the website went online!

- We then added more accessibility features and a link to our one and only performance.
