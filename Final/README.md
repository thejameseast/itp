#Final Project Documentation
##Ian Edmondson

- I am using chatgpt to code this entire website (with exception to the title and instructional sentence)
- I started by asking it to code me a single octave keyboard visual
- I then asked it to add an audio engine and make it playable with keyboard or mouse
	- It is using Web Audio API for audio synthesis and effects
- I then asked it to add distortion control and a low pass filter, as well as another octave
- I then asked it to add ADSR control and a graphical interface
- The distortion does not sound good. There is contstant distortion even when the slider is at 0.
- I am asking it to remove distortion
- I asked it to add a filter ADSR and waveform selector
- Holding the keys down would spam the notes, rather than sustain them. I am asking it to fix that.
- It has been fixed.
- I re-added the title and instructional sentence
- I asked it to show me the time values of the ADSRs and display it in milliseconds instead of seconds
- clicking the black keys with the mouse was not activating them, so i asked it to fix that.
- It is now done.
