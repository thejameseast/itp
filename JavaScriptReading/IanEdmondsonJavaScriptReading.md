Eloquent Javascript Reading

Chapter One:
	1. I knew that data is stored as sequences of bits
	2. I did not know that NaN stood for Not a Number
Chapter Two:
	1. I can confidently say that I did not know anything 	in this chapter prior to reading it
	2. I learned about binding operations. They seem cool 	and fun to use.
Chapter Three:
	1. I knew that you had to make and define functions
	2. I learned that JavaScript is very leniant about     	extra arguments used in functions.
