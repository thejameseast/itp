#Midterm Documentation
##Ian Edmondson


I started by getting the first sound working by copying and pasting from your midterm instructions

I tried copying and pasting two more times for the other two sounds, and this did not work.

I am currently considering using ChatGPT, but I want to try to go about it by myself first.

I am establishing the first, second, and third sounds under in the preload function, rather than establishing the preload function three different times

I am establishing three different playCustomSound functions

I am establishing three different soundLoaded functions to make sure each seperate sound is loaded

I am establishing three different keyPressed actions

I encountered a syntax error and am trying to fix it

It was a parentheses issue under the keyPressed function

"L" and "O" are playing the same sounds

I mistakenly told the system that two.mp3 was the second and third loaded sound

It is complete!! :D
