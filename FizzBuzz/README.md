#FizzBuzz Documentation
##Ian Edmondson

The first line defines the fizzBuzz functions with **limit** allowing me to set any value as the limit.

The second line establishes that when the function runs, **i** starts at 1 and increases until it reaches the established limit.

The third and fourth lines say that if **i** is divisible by 3 **AND** 5, the console will print "FizzBuzz"

The fifth and sixth lines say that if **i** is divisible by 3, then the console will print "Fizz""

The fifth and sixth lines say that if **i** is divisible by 5, then the console will print "Buzz""

The seventh and eighth lines say that if neither is applicable, then **i** will be printed.

fizzBuzz(100); Calls the function and sets 100 as the limit
