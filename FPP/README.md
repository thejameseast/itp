##Final Project Proposal

##Bloop

##Summary
- My project will be a web-based monophonic synthesizer.

##Resources
- I will be using ChatGPT, p5.js, A-Frame, RenPy, and Adafruit

##Details
- My project will be a web-based monophonic synthesizer. The user will be able to play it with their keyboard, or generate random notes within a chosen scale. It will offer basic sound design abilities as well (adsr, waveform options, filter, etc.). It will have a UI, offering a visual of piano keys, time-based ADSR duration selections, and waveform selector. It will also have a basic low-pass filter in which the cutoff value can be typed. 

##Overlap
- This work will overlap with my music-making career. I will hopefully have something that I can use to play and record for song production.

##Outlook
- I WILL accomplish creating a one-octave web-based synthesizer that, at the very least, plays audio files by responding to key presses.
- I THINK I can accomplish creating said synthesizer, along with an ADSR.
- I HOPE I can accomplish a synthesizer that can generate random notes, be played with the keyboard, and have an ADSR, filter, and waveform selector.
